In addition, I have experience building web applications, such as a gym website that features dynamic functionalities like load-shedding schedules and membership sign-ups.

Iâ€™m also deeply interested in the intersection of AI and health tech, having worked on an AI-driven doctor app that analyzes symptoms and offers prescriptions. This project, which won 2nd place at a hackathon, showcased my ability to innovate and collaborate within a team setting.
